# HEAD FIRST C
## LEARNING TAKES A LOT MORE THAN TEXT ON A PAGE.
Unless you flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head.  

Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Your brain will learn much more quickly a new, tough, technical topic if it's not boring. 

## Metacognition: thinking about thinking
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more
deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think.
Learn how you learn.  
To get the most from this any book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain.  

The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as
Really Important. Crucial to your well‑being. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.  

## So just how DO you get your brain to treat programming like it was a hungry tiger?
There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The
slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you are able to learn
and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t feel important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so I suppose it must be.”  
The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different types of brain activity. 

## Here’s what YOU can do to bend your brain into submission
#### 1. Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.
Don’t just read. Stop and think. When the book asks
you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine
that someone really is asking the question. The
more deeply you force your brain to think, the better
chance you have of learning and remembering.  

#### 2. Do the exercises. Write your own notes.
We put them in, but if we did them for you, that
would be like having someone else do your workouts
for you. And don’t just look at the exercises. Use a
pencil. There’s plenty of evidence that physical
activity while learning can increase the learning.  

#### 3. Read “There Are No Dumb Questions.”
That means all of them. They’re not optional
sidebars, **they’re part of the core content!**
Don’t skip them.

#### 4. Make this the last thing you read before bed.
Or at least the last challenging thing.
Part of the learning (especially the transfer to
long-term memory) happens after you put the book
down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more
processing. If you put in something new during that
processing time, some of what you just learned will
be lost.  

#### 5. Talk about it. Out loud.
Speaking activates is a different part of the brain. If
you’re trying to understand something, or increase
your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud.
Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else.
You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover
ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were
reading about it.  

#### 6. Drink water. Lots of it.
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid.
Dehydration (which can happen before you ever
feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.  

#### 7. Listen to your brain.
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting
overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim
the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time
for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you
won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and
you might even hurt the process.  

#### 8. Feel something.
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get
involved with the stories. Make up your own
captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke
is still better than feeling nothing at all.  

#### 9. Write a lot of code!
There’s only one way to learn to program in C:
write a lot of code. And that’s what you’re going
to do throughout this book. Coding is a skill, and
the only way to get good at it is to practice. We’re
going to give you a lot of practice: every chapter has
exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don’t
just skip over them—a lot of the learning happens
when you solve the exercises. We included a solution
to each exercise—don’t be afraid to peek at the
solution if you get stuck! (It’s easy to get snagged
on something small.) But try to solve the problem
before you look at the solution. And definitely get it
working before you move on to the next part of the
book.  

## The activities are NOT optional.
The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help you apply what you’ve learned. Don’t skip the exercises.  

# The Examples are written specifically for learning, and aren’t always fully functional.

## The Brain Power exercises don’t have answers.
For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning
experience of the Brain Power activities is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises, you will find hints to point you in the right direction.
